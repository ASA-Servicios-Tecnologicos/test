# Pending TODO's

- Add validators for all request's payload data (with class-validator decorators)
- Define types for all objects which now are "any" type
- Review the right use of asynchronous operations (Review if async/await syntax is right used, and if not's right used, refactor the code for do asynchronous operations right)
- Logger with wintons is already coded (search logger.ts in the project) but better implement Nest Logger with different logging levels (https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/logger)
- Review if is needed two authenticacion middlewares or not. If only is needed one, delete the other.
